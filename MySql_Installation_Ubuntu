Login to ubuntu using default user "ubuntu"

Step 1: Update System Packages and Install MySQL

  Run install update for your server system packages

    >> sudo apt update

  install MySQL using the below command to install the latest MySQL.


    >>sudo apt-get install mysql-server -y

  After successful installation of mysql-server, we can check the MySQL version by using this command

    >> mysql --version


Step 2: Configure MySQL Installation

  To configure the installation of MySQL, run the security script with sudo to run as the root user- the super privileged user.

  Run the below command-

     >> sudo mysql_secure_installation

          remove anonymous user: (press any key)
          Disallow remote login remotely: n
          remove test database and access to it: n
          Reload privilege tables now: y

  When we install MySQL for the first time, we will be prompted to create a new password.
  If you are getting an error while setting up the password, check the temporary password in the log file.

  Use the below command to get a temporary password.

    >> cat /var/log/mysqld.log


Step 3: Login into MySQL and Create a User

    Use the below command to login into MySQL:

    >> sudo mysql 

The command will log in to MySQL using the root user. Once you are logged in, create a user in the MySQL database using these commands:

  >> use mysql;
  >> CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';



Step 4: Grant Access Privileges to User

  Now, to grant access privileges to this newly created user, use this command:

    >> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'host';
    >> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Step 5: Connect User with MySQL

  Now you can use this user to connect with MySQL like this:
    >> mysql -u user -p



If you want to store passwords for that user, so prompting will not annoy us, do these things.
Create .my.cnf file inside /home/Ubuntu path

>> sudo nano .my.cnf

Write these lines in that file and save.

[mysql]
user=username
password=password

Now, whenever you want to connect, you can use this .my.cnf file like this, and no need to provide a password.

>> mysql --defaults-file=/home/ubuntu/.my.cnf -u username

Step 6: Restart MySQL Service

  To affect these changes, restart the MySQL service by following commands: 
  to check the status of MySQL service:

  >> systemctl status mysql.service

Now, if it is in “Running” mode, then restart it using the below command:

  >> sudo service mysql restart





UPDATING THE DATA DIRECTORY
----------------------------

1. Stop mysql
>> sudo service mysql stop
2. copy the existing database directory to the new location
>> copy -Rp /var/lib/mysql <new location path>

  -R flag to copy all the files and subdirectories inside the source directory recursively. 
  -p flag to keep the same permissions, ownership, and timestamps of the original files.

3. it’s a good practice to keep a backup of the original data in case something goes wrong
>> mv /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/mysql.bkp

4. point MySQL to the new data location by editing the configuration file at /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf.

datadir=/home/mysql     //Notably, we might have to uncomment the line if it’s commented.

5. edit /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld, change:

/var/lib/mysql/ r,    =>>> <newdir>/mysql/ r,
/var/lib/mysql/** /rwk, ===> <newdir>/mysql/** /rwk,

6. sudo /etc/init.d/apparmor restart
7. sudo chown -R mysql:mysql mysql
8. sudo service mysql start





CHECKING THE PASSWORD POLICY:
--------------------------------

mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate_password%';

mysql> SET GLOBAL validate_password.policy=LOW;

To make this setting permanent edit MySQL configuration (mysqld.cnf) file and add below settings.
[mysqld]
validate_password.policy=LOW

Save the file and restart the MySQL service to apply changes.


--- Uninstall password validation plugin:

mysql>> UNINSTALL COMPONENT 'file://component_validate_password';
