Login to ubuntu using default user "ubuntu"

Step 1: Update System Packages and Install MySQL

  Run install update for your server system packages

    >> sudo apt update

  install MySQL using the below command to install the latest MySQL.


    >>sudo apt-get install mysql-server -y

  After successful installation of mysql-server, we can check the MySQL version by using this command

    >> mysql --version


Step 2: Configure MySQL Installation

  To configure the installation of MySQL, run the security script with sudo to run as the root user- the super privileged user.

  Run the below command-

     >> sudo mysql_secure_installation

          remove anonymous user: (press any key)
          Disallow remote login remotely: n
          remove test database and access to it: n
          Reload privilege tables now: y

  When we install MySQL for the first time, we will be prompted to create a new password.
  If you are getting an error while setting up the password, check the temporary password in the log file.

  Use the below command to get a temporary password.

    >> cat /var/log/mysqld.log


Step 3: Login into MySQL and Create a User

    Use the below command to login into MySQL:

    >> sudo mysql 

The command will log in to MySQL using the root user. Once you are logged in, create a user in the MySQL database using these commands:

  >> use mysql;
  >> CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
